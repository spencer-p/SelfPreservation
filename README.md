# SelfPreservation

This is a game I created for [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) #39. The theme was "running out of power", and in my game you play a robot trying to defend itself with a limited amount of charge (or moves).

I'd encourage you to check out the [itch.io download page](https://spencerpeterson.itch.io/self-preservation) for more information, or the Ludum Dare [submission page](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/self-preservation), which includes the feedback I got.
